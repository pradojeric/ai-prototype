# Task — Zone 1 (Pantal Market) Prototype

## Objective
Playable browser prototype proving the full Zone 1 core loop, single-file (CDN importmap), placeholder visuals, mock API data.

## Checklist
- [x] Read GDD, confirm scope with user
- [x] Scaffold `index.html` with Three.js importmap + start screen (pointer lock)
- [x] Atmosphere: FogExp2, water plane, sediment particles, lighting
- [x] Pantal Market blockout (floor, stalls, hanging signs, bangkâ)
- [x] PlayerController: WASD + mouse look, wade speed, head bob + breathing sway
- [x] StringSystem: CatmullRom strings per artifact, animated drift, distance-driven count/opacity
- [x] ArtifactManager: 3 artifacts, per-session placement, proximity + interact (E)
- [x] DiscoveryScreen: fade-to-white modal, mock historical card, "Saved to Aking Museo"
- [x] HUD: artifact counter (x/3)
- [x] AudioManager: procedural string hum near artifact (no asset files)
- [x] Zone-complete state when 3/3 found

## Environment Pass (modular refactor + bigger zone)
- [x] Refactor single index.html → ES modules (`src/`, mirrors GDD architecture); index.html now a thin shell
- [x] Scale zone to ~96×96 m (`ZONE_HALF=48`), fog tuned to 0.03, larger floor/particles
- [x] Collision registry in `World` (circle-vs-AABB) + axis-separated SLIDE in PlayerController
- [x] Terrain: undulating seabed, rubble mounds, elevated slabs
- [x] Varied/broken/tilted stalls + central covered market hall landmark
- [x] Floating debris (crates/baskets/planks/fruit/nets) bobbing; large pieces solid
- [x] Enclosing perimeter building facades with window insets (solid boundary)
- [x] Re-seeded spawn nodes from real features; artifacts nudged clear of colliders
- [x] Static verify: all modules pass ES-module syntax check, serve 200, each < 1000 lines
- [ ] User in-browser verify: collisions slide, realism present, loop + 3/3 intact

## Map Redesign Pass (match reference district map)
Reference: top-down "Pantal Market District — The Flooded Memories" map.
Decisions: match layout closely · no carved channel (open lanes only) · keep seeded
random artifacts · keep south spawn (0,36). Orientation: map-N → -Z (far).
- [x] Memories Alley — dense small-building cluster w/ alleys (west, -X)
- [x] The Silent Auction Square — open plaza, dais, ring of short columns (center-north)
- [x] Ruined Fish Warehouse — large ruined shell landmark, open interior (center-right north)
- [x] Lost Boatyard — scattered bangkâs, A-frame cradles, shed (east, +X)
- [x] The Drowning Stalls — diagonal market rows (center)
- [x] Foggy Overlook — raised platform breaking the waterline (southeast)
- [x] Player Dock — planks + mooring posts + anchor at spawn (south, 0,36)
- [x] Perimeter facades bounding the edges (gaps for lanes + dock)
- [x] Re-anchor spawn nodes to the new districts; keep per-session jitter
- [x] Static verify: ES-module syntax OK, serves 200, World.js 470 lines
- [ ] User in-browser verify: districts read like the map, loop + 3/3 intact

## Module layout
- `index.html` — shell (HTML/CSS/importmap) → `src/main.js`
- `src/config.js`, `src/data.js` — config/utils, artifact data + mock API
- `src/core/` — World, StringSystem, ArtifactManager, PlayerController, Game
- `src/audio/AudioManager.js`, `src/ui/DiscoveryScreen.js`

## Decisions (from user)
- Scope: Core loop · Setup: CDN importmap (now multi-file ES modules over http) · API: Mock local
- Visuals: Placeholder primitives · Zone: ~2× · Collisions: props+walls (slide) · Assets: procedural only
